# Accident-Emergency-Room-Report

## Project Overview

Analyzing a hospital emergency room project overview on PowerBI involves visualizing data related to patient flow, wait times, resource allocation, and overall performance of the emergency department. PowerBI's interactive dashboards and data visualization capabilities helps in monitoring key metrics like patient arrival rates, treatment times, and staff utilization. By creating dynamic reports on PowerBI, stakeholders can gain insights into emergency room operations, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and patient care in the hospital's emergency department.
